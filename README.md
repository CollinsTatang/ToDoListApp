# To Do List: secure deploy

![Microverse](https://img.shields.io/badge/Microverse-blueviolet)

## Learning objectives
- To have a better understanding using webpack.
- Deploy a secure website using OpenSSL.

### Project requirements
- Commit and push all your work into the project's GitHub repository.
- If you worked with branches, make sure you merge all your work into the main branch.
- Deploy your website using GitHub Pages (you are already familiar with this process), but this time pay attention to the extra step that will ensure that your app uses HTTPS protocol:
- Scroll to the bottom of the Pages page and make sure the "Enforce HTTPS" checkbox is selected.
- Confirm the deployment. Your application will be live in few minutes. On the top of the Pages page you will find your project's URL.
- Make sure that your app URL uses SSL.
- Update the README of your repository to include a link to the online version.
